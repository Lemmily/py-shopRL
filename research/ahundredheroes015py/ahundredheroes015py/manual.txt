EXPOSITION
----------

Welcome to the world of 100 Heroes.

Having disassociated yourself with the life of an adventurer, after
one too many stupid deaths, you find yourself with a bag of coin
and a large appetite for exploiting people financially.

A small commercial tenancy has opened up in the town next door, you
jump at the chance to put a small deposit down and start trading.

Unfortunately, you spent most of your time in the dungeon stood in
one place repeatedly engraving 'Elbereth' on the floor, and paid
little attention to the various items you randomly and haphazardly
activated. You will have to start with nothing but the cash in your
pocket - and the willingness to crush other peoples dreams in order
to ensure your own financial security.



THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME
-------------------------

You might find yourself confused by the initial appearance of the
game. This is intended, as one of the basic tenets of any kind of
Roguelike-inspired game is that it should be accessible to as few
people as possible.

Despite the damage being done to your eyes, if you take a second
to examine the screen, you will see something like the following:

             ##################################
             #                |               #
             #    TOWN MAP    |    INFO BAR   #
             #                |               #
             #                |---------------#
             #                | HERO MESSAGES #
             #--------------------------------#
             #    GENERAL MESSAGES            #
             #                                #
             ##################################

If you have caught the game during one of the more pleasant versions,
there will be a small message welcoming you to the game in the
GENERAL MESSAGES part of the screen. Other messages pop up here from
time to time, informing you as to the happenings in the world.

HERO MESSAGES pop up to show pertinent events related to the
behavior of the Heroes - e.g. when they enter town, interact with
your shop etc.

The INFO BAR gives you information related to your own shop, any
active auctions, as well as the presence of monsters or heroes as
shown on the TOWN MAP.

The TOWN MAP shows a small little town, where you are trading, and
where other shops are trading. You are the Yellow shop.

Other shops are shown by a deeper blue. Remember the particular
factions by the different icons.

A number of dungeons will exist, just outside the town in the forest.
These are red, and give off a pleasant rougelike glow.

Try entering your shop.

You can do this by either:

	a) left-clicking on your shop with the mouse.
	b) pressing the 'i' key.

You will then see a small dialog box asking you if you really DO want
to enter the shop. This is partially to make sure that any action in
the game takes as many key-presses as possible, but also as sometimes
the shop owner will not be interested in letting you in to the shop.

This can be remedied by increasing your reputation, or the decrease
of that particular shops reputation.

Other shops are entered by left-clicking on them.


OTHER SHOPS
-----------

When in another shop, you can look at the items on sale by pressing
the relevant number key associated with that item.

When you are looking at a particular item, you can:

	buy it at the listed price by pressing 'b'.

You may notice at the start of the game that each item is limited
in the display of pertinent information about the items. This is
remedied by owning items, and examining them whilst in your own
shop.


EXAMINING STUFF
---------------

This process will enable you to tell whether a 'curved sword' is
a sabre, or a scimitar. After playing the game a few times, you
might also begin to realise that there are only two types of curved
sword. This goes for everything else, and enables you to make
considered bids on the various types of equipment.

The first level of 'examining' things reveals the item type, and the
base value. This can therefore be the most important stage of
identification.

This information persists through the game, so if you know what
ONE sabre looks like, you can recognise every other sabre in the
game.

Scrolls are slightly different, in that the only real thing that
separates them is the 'name' of the scroll. Here you will have to
use a bit of judgement as to whether the price seems fair.


LOOKING FOR A BARGAIN?
----------------------

You could possibly go through the various shop inventories and see if
there are a number of scrolls for sale with the same name. In this
case, the scroll listed at the lowest price is likely to be the best
buy.



AUCTION HOUSE
-------------

As you are likely to be entering it often, you can:

	enter the Auction House by pressing the 'a' key.

or alternatively clicking on it on the town map.

Whilst in the Auction House, you will be presented with an option to
place a bid on the current item offered for sale.

	If you do want to place a bid press the 'p' key

You have other options, if you want to try and be a bit more canny.

	To view other potential bidders, press 'o'

The Auctioneer will tell you who has visited the Auction House. These
people may, or may not choose to place a bid, and new people visit all
the time throughout a given day. You can use this information to decide
how you want to pitch your bid. e.g. going up against a lot of Fighters,
Swashbucklers and Barbarians for particular types of weapons will mean
that it is likely that the item will go for somewhere around its real
value.

Conversely, bidding for a scroll against the same set of people will
mean it is far more likely that you can get it at a low price.

	To view future auctions, press the 'f' key.

This enables you to judge whether you want to save more realistic
bids for future auctions. If you really want that Ceremonial Cuirass
that is coming up in a couple of days, save your money for that.

This doesn't stop you from bidding low amounts every day, and you
should always try and do this, as there are occasions where sometimes
items are not won by anyone. In this case, for unexplained reasons,
the item will be fed in its entirety to a Dragon.


CONTRACTS
---------

Contracts are one of the ways you can directly affect the paths of the
heroes (aside from offering bargain prices and unmatched after-sales
service).

Heroes get a chance to be involved in all sorts of contracts, but for
now you, as a player, can only raise three different types.

ITEM HUNT
	asks a hero to go down in to a dungeon of your choosing, and
pick out an item from one of the chests or alcoves where items tend
to be lying about. If the hero is successful, he'll come and deliver
it to your shop for the agreed price. You pay the hero after
delivery, so the risk is fairly minimal to you. You won't always get
a bargain, although if you are patient and frugal with your outgoings
you shouldn't do too bad.

MONSTER HUNT
	If there are monsters patrolling the town looking to cause
a bit of all-round havoc, raise one of these contracts to try and
bring the little tike down a peg or two.

DUNGEON DELVE
	Raise one of these contracts if you just want the heroes to
go and do a bit of general adventuring. There are no rewards, apart
from the satisfaction of knowing you are directly involved in the
murder of many creatures down in the depths.

The Mayoress, and other shops, may raise contracts either on their own
accord or if petitioned by visiting heroes.


RUMOURS
-------

	Occasionally heroes will discover things about the world and
the dungeons that they won't resist being able to talk about. Rumours
may affect the way heroes choose to go about their business - be it to
try and find treasure, evil altars or other such hidden abominations.


HERO BEHAVIOUR
--------------

	Hero behaviour is affected by a number of things, notably their
personalities and the general goings on in town. They make decisions on
where to shop based generally on the perceived success of shops, or how
suitable each shop is to meet their particular needs.

	They are more likely to visit shops that are near them, stock
the same sort of item they are trying to procure, and also will make a
judgement (based on their personality) about the recent levels of
activity happening in the shop. Try and make sure you are active in
buying, selling and stocking items at all times to maximise your appeal.
In any case, some heroes will also like to visit less busy shops, so
you shouldn't ever get to a position whereby people are always
completely ignoring you (although if you start on the perimeter of the
town, it will be more difficult to attract visitors).


MONSTERS
--------

	Every now and again, a monster will spring forth from one of the
dungeons, and carry out some dastardly scheme on the town. They will
generally try and get in to the guts of the town and cause a bit of
carnage, ransacking shops.

	The Mayoress will try and stop the monster by putting out
contracts to destroy them, and you may choose to help her by putting out
your own contracts to hasten their demise.

	Currently, however, you do still need some willing participants
to go and take the monster on - so good luck with that.
